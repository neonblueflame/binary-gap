# binary-gap
This implementation of binary gap prints the longest binary gap found in the provided integer. The input should be a decimal integer that is a whole, real number, greater than 0. It does so by converting the integer into its binary form stored in an array. Then, it gets the longest binary gap by getting the largest difference between positions of ones in the number.

Use C99 clang to compile.
