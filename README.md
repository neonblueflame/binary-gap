# binary-gap
This implementation of binary gap prints the longest binary gap fount in the provided integer. The input should be a decimal integer that is a whole, real number, greater than 0. It does so by converting the integer into its binary form stored in an array. Then, it should get the longest binary gap by getting the largest difference between positions of ones in the number.
